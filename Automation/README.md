# Automation

This folder links to my automation projects. The runnable code lives in separate repos so you can review real, working examples.

## UI automation (Cypress, SauceDemo)
Repo: https://github.com/yltsmees/saucedemo-cypress-portfolio

What you’ll see:
- End-to-end flows (login, inventory, cart, checkout)
- Page Object Model (POM)
- Fixtures and custom commands
- Clean, readable test IDs

## API automation (Postman + Newman, GoREST)
Repo: https://github.com/yltsmees/gorest-postman-newman-portfolio

What you’ll see:
- Postman collection + Newman runs (local + CI)
- HTML reports
- Token-safe environment handling (no secrets committed)
- Chained requests using environment variables (IDs saved and reused)

## How to review fast
1) Open the UI repo and skim folder structure and a couple specs.
2) Open the API repo and check the collection structure and Newman run setup.
3) Use these projects as examples of maintainable test automation and reporting.
